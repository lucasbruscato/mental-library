This course was taught by nobel prize laureate Professor Robert Shiller. He talks about the (lack of) use of narrative in economics and finance, and how the field of study could benefit in the use of it. The overall idea is to understand
and identify the narratives in economics that underlie its changes.

The course is composed by four weeks:

### Week 1 - Introduction week elaborating on what will be focused

1. He makes parallels of epidemics and economics trends, how the information circulates and reaches people.
2. He elaborates on the use of a tool called [Google's Ngrams](https://books.google.com/ngrams/) to search the occurrence of words and phrases in Google's database of books.
3. He elaborates on a concept called [[Animal Spirits]] and gives a few examples to illustrate such concept.

### Week 2 - Elaborates on seven propositions about the [[virality]] of narrative economics

#### Proposition 1 - Epidemics can be fast or slow, big or small
He illustrates that certain epidemics can take years to happen, and also discuss that not because a certain narrative sticked around for too long that it means it's factual.

#### Proposition 2 - Important economic narratives may comprise a very small percentage of popular talk
He explains that not because there is a major economic event happening that it will be, necessarily, part of the popular talk. He uses the 1929 stock market crash as an example, while it was believed that plenty of people were talking about it, their main topic was to not starve.

#### Proposition 3 - Narrative constellations have more impact than any one narrative
He explains that there is a human predilection for certain stories, and when there is a big picture attached to the story it is easier to get more people committed to it, that's the narrative constellation. E.g.: tuberculosis epidemics tends to spread when AIDS is spreading.

#### Proposition 4 - The economic impact of narrative may change through time
He elaborates on the fact that sometimes the meaning of a certain narrative change over time, and people lose track what it used to be and start reinterpreting in a new way, therefore, valuing differently.

#### Proposition 5 - Truth is not enough to stop false narratives
He explains that usually true stories are not the most interesting ones, thus, incorrect narratives usually spread more and faster than true ones. An interesting fact was that he shows that fake news was something that has been happening for quite a while, e.g.: a ship exploded in a US dock and a newspaper blamed Spain, the spaniards denied but they kept with the narrative and created more impressive and false stories.

#### Proposition 6 - Contagion of economic narratives builds on opportunities for repetition
His theory is that if there is a constant reminder of any specific thing, it can become a "catch" phrase or trend worldwide, such as the "Happy birthday to you" song that is basically translated to multiple languages using the same rhythm.

#### Proposition 7 - Narratives thrives on attachment: human interest, identity and patriotism
He explains that attachment has all to do with repetition and constellation, e.g.: there was a famous study that showed that if you charged 90% (a) or 10% (b) on people's income a government would obtain the same tax, as people on (a) would evade tax and (b) would pay, therefore, better to stick to (a). The draft (screenshot below) made for that went viral as taxation is a hot topic among people.

### Week 3 - Elaborates on nine perennial economic narratives

1. Labor-saving machines replace jobs:
Although it seems like a new narrative, the idea that labor-saving machines would replace all jobs goes back tons of years. He quotes Aristotle in Politics (350 BC) that if a machine could do most of the work, chief workmen wouldn't want servants and slaves, he also mentions that even Einstein believed that the 1929 stock market crash was due to technological unemployment.

2. Automation and AI replace almost all jobs:
The first narrative is more focused on arms, legs and hands, whereas AI would replace jobs that required a certain reasoning. Again, it's not a new narrative.

3. Frugality versus conspicuous consumption:
He explains the emergence of different terms throughout time, including the term "American Dream" that got popularised after WWII that would advocate for conspicuous consumption for every man according to their merit as well.

4. Panic versus confidence:
He elaborates on the inversion of panic and consumer confidence over time, also the emergence of the term "the great depression" which came around the 50s, some decades after the 1929 crash.

5. The gold standard versus bimetallism:
He explains the different trends that happened for the "gold standard", which is basically the concept used by governments to back up finance by gold, whereas bimetallism is the introduction of the usage of silver coins as well. Gold standard usually gets more popular during recessions.

6. Real estate booms and busts:
Curiously, the introduction of companies/websites that showed the price of houses (their address and photos) caused an increase in real estate market, since people would assume that they could make money buying low and selling high houses in neighbourhoods they knew.

7. Stock market bubbles:
He explains that there is a tendency to tell the stories of winners and forget the losers, specially when it comes to the subject about money. This greatly influences and creates trends in the stock market. And also that the narrative that people think the market is being overpriced is recurrent and old.

8. Boycotts, profiteers, and evil business:
There is an interesting story about companies (that became known as evil businesses) that raised the price of goods among people who were needy because of the WWI, people blamed these evil businesses and not the Federal Reserve for allowing inflation, and also how those people increased the severity of the crisis when they decided to stop buying goods that they believe were overpriced, causing a deflation and also pushing the prices down.
He also explains where the term boycott comes from, which was the name of an executive in Ireland in 1880.

9. The wage-price spiral and evil labor unions:
The idea of the wage-price spiral implies that an increase in prices results in unions negotiating an increase in wage that implies in the need for more revenue from the companies thus implying in higher prices.

### Week 4 - Consilience: who can teach us?

1. **Introduction**: he elaborates on what [[consilience]] means and it's origin.
2. **Education**: he argues that most CEOs have a very broad background and there is a trend for people taking bachelors with a minor in a subject and a major in something completely different (e.g., minor in Astronomy and major in Economics, this is called liberal arts education). And finally, how important it is to have a knowledge in a wide range of topics and keep learning, also the benefits of having a consilient mind and how that leads to a leadership potential.
3. **Leadership**: he elaborates on Franklin D Roosevelt ability to create strong positive narratives and also how narratives, once released, are out there and are open for interpretation and change in meaning over time.
4. **Doing the research**: he explains that currently the research is still weak wrt consilience, but it's improving over time.
5. **Your own narrative**: he elaborates on how important are personal narratives to your own personal success, also he raises awareness on not being cynical and concern about being moral when being a very influential character.
