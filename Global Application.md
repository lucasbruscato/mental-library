A global application is an application deployed in multiple geographic regions.

Some of the reasons it might be needed are:
1. Decreased Latency: deploy the application closer to where the user is based to decrease the latency.
2. Disaster Recovery (DR): if an the region where the application is deployed goes down or there is a fail, the application can still work with a fail-over strategy.
3. Attack protection: a distributed global infrastructure decreases the chances of an attack.
