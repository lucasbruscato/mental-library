This class is taught by Professor Larry McEnerney from the University of Chicago and available in Youtube ([LEADERSHIP LAB: The Craft of Writing Effectively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM&t=3727s)).

The professor mainly talks about how people are taught to write as a thinking method, i.e., write explaining and understanding the ideas to themselves instead of focusing on explaining and selling the idea to the reader.

He argues that:
1. One should find the problem the reader is interested at and start with that.
2. Be aware that something new doesn't necessarily mean it will be something knowledgeable (or useful).
3. Also catch the attention of the public stating, if necessary, where they are wrong.
4. Use words such as "anomaly", "inconsistent", "but", "however", "although" to generate tension, challenge and contradiction if needed.
5. When describing the problem (point 1) one should raise a) instability and b) cost or benefit for the audience. As always, focus on the audience not on what could be seen as interesting and cool.
6. Finally, don't wait too long to propose a solution for the problem, preferably shortly after the presentation of the problem.

The driver of the class was the lag between what one tries to explain and what the audience (reader) is trying to understand.
