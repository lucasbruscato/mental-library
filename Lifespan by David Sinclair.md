David Sinclair is an Australian professor and researcher - being quite reputed in his area of research - that worked for MIT and Harvard both teaching and doing research on biology and the science of aging, specifically on how to increase lifespan.

In the book the author treats aging as a disease, he elaborates mainly in two perspectives:

1. Chemical / Biological / Genetical:
	1. he states that one day, possibly not too long in the future, studies will advance enough to enable a change in DNA that could slow down aging or even reverse it.

2. Behavioural:
	1. among a few topics, he raises on having a good life one should be exercising every day, eating less, eating more vegetables, fruits, less meat and less ultra-processed food.
