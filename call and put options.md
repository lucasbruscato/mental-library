Call and put options are operations in the financial market that relies on the underlying believe from the trader that the stock will increase or decrease, respectively, thus a call operation the trader buys the "right to buy" a stock at a certain price, whereas a put operation the trader buys the "right to sell" a stock at a certain price.

The execution date varies according to the market, in the US it can be anytime before the expiration date and in the EU it should be only at the exact expiration date.

An example of a call option:
1. The trader buys the "right" to buy a stock in the future, which the trader believes it will increase in the future.
2. Let's say the `Market price = USD 36`.
3. The trader pays a fee (called premium) to buy such right, let's say `Premium = USD 10`.
4. The trader sets a strike price, let's say `Strike price = USD 30`.
5. The premium is set by the market and most times it will be higher than the difference between the `Strike price` and the `Market price`, which in this example is `USD 6`.

These type of operations serve as hedges (similar to an insurance) since the risk is limited, example below, there is no upper bound to the total return and the lower bound is limited to `USD 2` (using it as the `Premium` in the example).

There are several other "features" that make these operations even more complex. Writing the options, i.e. offering them to the traders offers more risks than just buying options as the "writer" will have to honor the operation.
