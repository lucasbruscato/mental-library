This book elaborates on [[factor investing]] overall theory and also makes a review over the [[most famous factors in factor investing]] when building a factor-based portfolio.

It starts explaining that both economic logic and a large body of research has shown that discretionary stock picking is not the path to riches. The book explains the most famous factors covering them by chapters, in each chapter it shows:

- a summary of the theory behind the factor
- persistent, i.e., how long it has been present and also a metric to measure it ([[Sharpe ratio]])
- pervasive, i.e., it's present in different financial markets (continents, countries, etc.)
- investable, i.e., feasibility to capture such factor with indexes and funds
- intuitive, i.e., clear and straightforward explanation on how the factor works

The book also shows that many legendary investors, such as Warren Buffett, Benjamin Graham, David Dodd, identified key characteristics in the market and in stocks that would deliver above-market returns, and later would be understood by scholars as factors (most listed in the [[most famous factors in factor investing]]).

The book also states that the risk of an asset should never be viewed in isolation, whenever thinking about an investment, it should be considered how its addition impacts the risk and expected return of the entire portfolio.
