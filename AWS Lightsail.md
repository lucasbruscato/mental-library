Lightsail is a great tool for people with little cloud experience, it sets up the virtual servers, storage, databases and networking.

The main points:
1. It has a low and predictable price
2. It's a simpler alternative to using [[AWS EC2]], [[AWS RDS]], [[AWS Elastic Load Balancer]], [[AWS EBS Volume]] etc
3. Use cases:
	1. simple web applications (has several templates)
	2. websites (again, templates)
	3. for dev/test environment
4. A disadvantage is that it has limited AWS integrations
