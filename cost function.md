The cost function in machine learning is the mathematical function that formulates the error (or loss) when trying to find a relation between the input and output.

For example, for the linear regression model, the cost function will be the minimum of the root mean squared error of the model, which is obtained by subtracting the predicted values from observed values.

- h is the linear regression function
- x is the input
- y is the observed value

$$

J(\theta) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n}{(h_\theta(x^i) - y^i)^2}

$$
