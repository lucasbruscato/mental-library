This book is written by Edward O. Thorp, and it tells the story of his life. The author became quite famous for a few reasons, such as: being considered a self-made man, creator of several game theories and also for being great at investing in the stock market.

The book can be split by:

1. Early days
	1. The author tells some stories about his infancy: how curious he was; experiments he took; work as a paperboy; exhaustion for long working hours, sleeping and crashing while riding his bike.
	2. His family conflicts: parents divorce; uncontrolled mother.
	3. Financing his college years: had to go to UCLA instead of Berkeley since they offered a better scholarship.
2. Casino
	1. He created in 1961 a theory for winning the blackjack (21) game which he developed making several simulations with an old IBM computer. He was the precursor of card counting (add more about the theory #todo).
	2. Together with Claude Shannon he also created one of the first portable computers (located in his shoe which would be activated by his big toe) to calculate the speed of a ball in roulette - based on the time it would take to make a round between two point in the roulette -, and subsequently predicting which group of pockets the ball would land, he also mentioned the "landing" would form a normal distribution.
3. Stock market
	1. He found a company called Principal Newport Partners (PNP) with Jay Regan in 1969, it was one of the first hedge funds and they managed to repeatedly have extraordinary annualized returns, specially when comparing to other managed funds and the overall stock market. They were one of the first to run quantitative trading techniques and make profit over mispricings in derivatives ([[short selling]], operating with [[call and put options]]).
	2. Amid the success of the company, many big figures in Hollywood, Casino business and other big names of the time decided to get their money invested with PNP.
	3. In 1991 he evaluated and had strong evidence to believe that Bernie Madoff was conducting a Ponzi scheme, he tried alerting other people but few believed, Madoff conducted the scheme for around 20 years, only being exposed in 2008.
