The Sharpe ratio compares the return of an investment with its risk, it was created by economist William F. Sharpe in 1966.

The numerator is the difference over time between realized, or expected, returns and a benchmark such as the risk-free rate of return or the performance of a particular investment category.

The denominator is the standard deviation of returns over the same period of time, a measure of volatility and risk.

Thus, the higher the Sharpe ratio the better, i.e., higher returns and lower volatility.

Example:

Suppose a mutual fund has an expected return over time of 25%, a risk-free rate of return of 2.70% and the standard deviation of 20%, thus, the Sharpe ratio would be:

(25 - 2.70) / 20 = 1.11
