The momentum factor is defined as being the tendency for assets that have performed well in the recent past to continue to perform well in the future, at least for a short period of time. The opposite is also true, i.e., assets that have performed poorly in the recent past to continue to perform poorly in the future.

The formula consists in collecting the last 12 months of returns excluding the most recent month (in other words, months 2-12), the most recent month is excluded as it tends to show a reversal. Then, momentum is the average return of the top 30 percent of stocks minus the average return of the bottom 30 percent as ranked by this measure.

The momentum factor is usually referred to as UMD (Up Minus Down).
