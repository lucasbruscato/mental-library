Security groups in AWS are the fundamental of network security, they control the traffic that is allowed into or out of your EC2 instances. They only contain allow rules.

They regulate:
- Access to ports
- Authorised IP ranges - IPv4 and IPv6
- Control of inbound network
- Control of outbound network

Also, security groups can refer to:
1. Ip addresses (some [[Classic IT Ports]] to know)
2. Other security groups (screenshot below)
