Market beta expresses the degree to which an asset moves with the broad market.

Its mathematical definition is the correlation between the asset's return and the market's return, multiplied by the ratio of the asset's volatility to the market's volatility (as measured by the standard deviation of returns).

Thus, by definition, a portfolio containing the whole market (all stocks) has a beta of exactly one.
