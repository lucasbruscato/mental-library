The VPC endpoints allow the user to connect to AWS services using a private network instead of the public www network.

This service enhances security and lower latency for internal access.

There are only two types of endpoints:
1. Gateway: for [[AWS S3]] and [[AWS Amazon DynamoDB]]
2. Interface: for all rest of services
