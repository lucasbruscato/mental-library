Databases can be divided mainly in two types:

1. Relational:
	1. can have "links" between tables
	2. can use SQL language to perform queries / lookups
2. NoSQL:
	1. non relational databases, i.e., no links between tables
	2. built for specific data models and have flexible schemas for building modern applications
	3. benefits: flexible, scalable (distributed clusters), high-performance, highly functional
	4. examples: key-value, document, graph, in-memory, search databases
