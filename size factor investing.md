The size factor expresses the difference in returns of small minus big cap stocks.

The size factor is calculated by taking the annual average return of small-cap stocks and subtracting the annual average return of large-cap stocks. Usually referred as SMB, small minus big.

Small-cap stocks are the ones defined as being within deciles 6-10 of the CRSP index, and large-cap stocks as those within deciles 1-5 of the CRSP index.
