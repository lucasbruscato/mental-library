**Profitability** is defined as revenue minus cost of goods sold. Firms with high profitability measured by earnings have high subsequent returns after controlling for BtM ratio and investment.

The strategies built on profitability are growth strategies, so they provide an excellent hedge for value strategies, thus, adding profitability on top of a value strategy reduces the strategy's overall volatility.

**Quality** is defined as the returns of high-quality companies minus the returns of low-quality companies (quality minus junk, QMJ).

High-quality companies are defined as having these traits: low earnings volatility, high margins, high asset turnover (indicating efficient use of assets), low financial leverage, low operating leverage (indicating a strong balance sheet and low macroeconomic risk) and low stock-specific risk (volatility that is unexplained by macroeconomic activity).
