SNS stands for Simple Notification Service and it's a service used to deliver the same incoming notification into multiple registered services.

The properties:

1. The "event publisher" only sends message to one SNS topic
2. The user can register as many "event subscribers" as they please
3. Each subscriber to the topic will get all the messages
