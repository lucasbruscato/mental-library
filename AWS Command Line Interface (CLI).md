The CLI is an open-source tool from [[AWS]] that enables you to interact with AWS services via the command line directly from your local machine.

To connect the CLI to your AWS account, you should use a protected key pair:
- **access key id** = can be interpreted as a username
- **secret access key** = can be interpreted as a password

As an alternative to AWS CLI there is also [[AWS CloudShell]].
