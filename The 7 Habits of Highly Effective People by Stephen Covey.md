As the name of the book goes, the book presents seven habits that everybody should follow as a framework for developing personal effectiveness and improving relationships with others.

The seven habits are:

1. Be proactive
2. Begin with the end in mind
3. Put first things first
4. Think win-win
5. Seek first to understand, then to be understood
6. Synergize
7. Sharpen the saw

The author elaborate on each one of those:

1. **Be proactive:** take responsibilities for your actions and choices instead of blaming external factors for it.
2. **Begin with the end in mind:** have a clear view on goals and vision before taking an action.
3. **Put first things first:** have a prioritization level for your tasks based on importance and urgency.
4. **Think win-win:** try to get into a mutually beneficial solution for all parties involved in an agreement or interaction, this pays out in the long run.
5. **Seek first to understand, then to be understood:** try to listen and understand empathetically others before trying to convince them about your thoughts or opinions. People usually pay more attention to your point of view if they feel they are heard as well.
6. **Synergize:** present a team player attitude to leverage on collaboration to achieve better results.
7. **Sharpen the saw:** keep learning and evolving yourself through activities such as exerce, reading, meditation and learning a new skill. One should always be improving their physical, mental and emotional wellbeing.
