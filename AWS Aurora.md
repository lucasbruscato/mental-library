Aurora is a proprietary technology from AWS, it's not open source.

It claims to be cloud optimized and performing over 5x better than MySQL and over 3x better than Postgres (both on RDS).

However, the service is relatively expensive (20% more than RDS) and the storage automatically grows in increments of 10GB up to 128TB.
