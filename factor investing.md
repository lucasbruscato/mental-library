Eugene Fama and Kenneth French proposed in 1992 a three-factor model that, along with the [[market beta factor investing]], would add exposure to the [[size factor investing]] and the [[value factor investing]] to further explains the differences in returns of diversified portfolios.

The [[CAPM model]] was able to explain roughly 66% of the difference in returns between diversified portfolios, with the addition of the size and the value factors, this figure raised to around 90%.

Example:

- Portfolio A returns 10 percent
- Portfolio A returns 13 percent

The difference in market betas (given by the CAPM model) between the two portfolios would be able to explain 2 percentage points of the 3 percentage point difference in returns. With the addition of size and value, the Fama-French model would be able to explain more than 2.7 percent.
