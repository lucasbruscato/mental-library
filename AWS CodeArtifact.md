The service does the storing and retrieving of dependencies (code dependencies) of each deployed artifact, this is known as artifact management.

Traditionally the users would have to maintain their own artifact management system, CodeArtifact is a service to facilitate this.

It works with common dependency management tools, such as:
- pip
- Maven
- Gradle
- npm
- yarn
- NuGet
