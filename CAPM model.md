The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a mathematical model that estimates the expected return of an investment (or asset) based on its riskiness relative to the rest of the market.

The model is based on the relationship between an asset's beta ([[risk-free rate]]) and the equity risk premium (or expected return on the market minus the risk-free rate).
