At AWS there are three MFA options:

1. Virtual MFA device: an app that contains different MFA codes, for example: google authenticator
2. Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) Security Key: a physical device that connects to the computer accessing the account
3. Hardware Key Fob MFA Device: a physical device that provides a key and it doesn't need to be connected to the computer
