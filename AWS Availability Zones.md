Each [[AWS Region]] has many availability zones (also known as AZ), but it's usually 3 (min 3, max 6). For example:

AWS Region Europe (Ireland) is called `eu-west-1` and has 3 availability zones:
- `eu-west-1a`
- `eu-west-1b`
- `eu-west-1c`

Each AZ is composed by one or more data centers with redundant power, networking and connectivity. They are separated from each other but connected with ultra-low latency networking.
