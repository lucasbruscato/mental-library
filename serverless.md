Serverless is a new paradigm in which the users don't have to manage the servers anymore.

There are still servers in serverless, but it's transparent to the user, therefore, the user just need to deploy and build their application.

Some examples of serverless services in AWS:

- [[AWS S3]]
- [[AWS Amazon DynamoDB]]
- [[AWS Fargate]]
- [[AWS Lambda]]
