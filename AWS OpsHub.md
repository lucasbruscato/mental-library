The AWS OpsHub is a software you install on your computer to manage your [[AWS Snow Family]] devices (Snowcone, Snowball Edge or Snowmobile).

Among a few things, it can enable the user to:
1. Configure a single or clustered device
2. Transfer files
3. Launch and manage instances running on Snow Family devices
4. Monitor device metrics (storage capacity, active instances etc)
5. Launch AWS services on the device: [[AWS EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud]], [[AWS DataSync]], etc.
