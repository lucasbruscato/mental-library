Short selling or short position refers to a financial operation that involves borrowing a stock in the market and selling it at the given price, then, after an agreed amount of time, buying it back and effectuating the difference. The trader believes that the stock will decrease in the near future.

Example:

>An individual borrows a Tesla stock for 100 USD, makes the short operation (selling for the 100 USD), holds this operation for 6 months, buys the stock back at 60 USD and returns the borrowed stock, therefore making 40 USD in profits (without taking into account brokerage fees).

Since the value of the stock can increase to infinity, so can the losses of such operations.

Short selling and buying put options (from [[call and put options]]) are similar strategies where the trader believes the stock will decrease in value.
