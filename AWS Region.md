[[AWS]] has server center in different regions, how to choose a region might depend on a few factors, such as:

- Compliance: from a data governance and legal perspective, where should the services and data be based?
- Proximity: to reduce latency for customers or whoever is using the services
- Available services: the availability of services vary from region to region, not all new products are available in all regions
- Pricing: pricing varies region to region

Each AWS Region can also have multiple [[AWS Availability Zones]].
