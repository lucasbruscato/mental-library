A DNS is a collection of rules and records which helps the client understand and reach a server through URLs.

Some examples of records:

- www.google.com points to the ip 12.34.56.78, which is IPv4
- www.google.com also points to the ip 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334, which is a IPv6
- search.google.com points to www.google.com, which is an example of CNAME (hostname to hostname)
