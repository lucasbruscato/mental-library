It's a tool to manage extract, transform and load (ETL) services.

It's a fully [[serverless]] service that can connect to, for example:

[[AWS S3]] buckets and [[AWS RDS]] databases, extract the data, transform and load into another system such as [[AWS Amazon Redshift]]

The "Glue Data Catalog" stores all datasets and can be used by [[AWS Amazon Athena]], [[AWS Amazon Redshift]] and [[AWS Amazon EMR]].
